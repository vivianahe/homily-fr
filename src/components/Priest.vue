            So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was
            terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers
            a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine
            intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you
            Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist.
